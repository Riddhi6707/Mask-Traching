# MaskNet-Code

31.3.2021 - First Draft with no documentations and few errors to debug.

1.04.2021 - Offline Train script completed. 

2.04.2021 - Online Train & Prediction + 1st Offline Train Log.
            Offline Train in 1st attempt has not been good. Further adjustments underway.


3.04.2021 - Project Description added. 
            Training underway to ensure better performance




5.04.2021 - Working model is added. The scripts are ready. However, model performance is not noteworthy, poor to say the least.
            Work continues to get the model do proper segmentation. 


6.04.2021 - A performing model has been established as follows :

            With offline training, the model is able to predict     instances segmentation with dice coefficient values above 0.80 
            With online training during prediction, the model performs poorly when the first annotations is augmented. However, without augmentation, model can perform well and improves the offline training prediction
